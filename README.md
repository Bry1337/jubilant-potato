# News Application built in Kotlin-MVP Pattern
This project is open source even though it is uploaded in playstore [News Application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tickr.tickr), the reason of the source code being in public is to showcase how the application was built.

## Framework Included
 1. RxJava2
 2. Dagger2
 3. Retrofit2
 4. OkHttp
 5. ButterKnife
 6. Firebase
 7. Apache Common Utility Libraries
## Design Pattern
MVP (Model-View-Presenter) is the design pattern used to build this to separate the layers and entities from each other specially logic [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/Bry1337/fuzzy-computing-machine). This also includes [SOLID Principle](https://www.baeldung.com/solid-principles) so when you try to change anything the whole application would not collapse, basically speaking, decoupled.
